                    <li className="m-bot-new">One of the most common adoption policies for electric vehicles is purchase
                      subsidies,
                      which lower the initial cost of ownership at the expense of high costs on the government.
                      Though the upfront cost of an electric vehicle is much more than that of an internal combustion
                      vehicle, the operational and maintenance cost of an electric vehicle is much less than the latter.
                      In this way, by implementing policies that further cut operational costs in addition to the
                      purchase
                      incentive, governments can further persuade people to buy electric vehicles. For ZETs, the
                      government
                      is yet to announce favorable policies.</li>

                    <li className="m-bot-new">In 2017, the Government of India passed a regulation defining the first-ever
                      fuel consumption
                      standards
                      for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), which include HDT's and buses; it took effect on April 1, 2023.
                    </li>

                    <li className="m-bot-new">With supportive polices ZETs can achieve an 85% sales penetration by 2050.
                      With cost
                      competitiveness,
                      and technology maturity, nearly 9 in 10 trucks sold in 2050 can be ZETs. Demand-side policies to
                      increase

                      incentives, zero-emissions zones, and fleet purchase requirements.
